#### **General Overview**

Welcome to the public good experiment. You will be part of a group of 4 participants, and you will interact with the same group throughout the experiment. The experiment consists of 5 rounds, and your decisions will affect both your earnings and the earnings of others in your group. All decisions are anonymous, and you will not know the identity of other participants.

#### **1\. Instructions**

Your group will start with an initial endowment of 10 tokens.

You must decide how many tokens to contribute to a public account and how many to keep in your private account.

Tokens in the public account will be multiplied by a factor of 2 and distributed equally among all group members. Tokens kept in your private account will not be shared and remain yours.

**Example**:

* You have 10 tokens.  
* If you contribute 4 tokens to the public account:  
  * These 4 tokens are doubled to 8 and shared equally among the group.  
  * Each group member receives 2 tokens (8 ÷ 4).  
* You keep the remaining 6 tokens in your private account.

Contributions to the public account benefit everyone, including you.

What you keep in your private account benefits only you.

Your total earnings for each round equal to

**private tokens kept \+ public tokens earned**

At the end of each round, you will see:

1. The total tokens contributed to the public account by all members.  
2. Your earnings from the public account.  
3. Your private tokens kept from the round.  
4. Your total earnings so far.

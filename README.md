# Talkingâ€¯toâ€¯Machines Platform (Beta Release)


The **talkingtomachines** platform is developed to facilitate the design, conduct, and analysis of large-scale experimental trials and treatments through LLM-powered agents. 

---

## âœ¨Â Features

* **CLIâ€‘first Workflow** â€“ build and run large-scale experimental trials straight from your terminal.
* **Python API** â€“ the same engine is importable as a Python package in notebooks and pipelines.
* **Multiâ€‘model Provider** â€“ ships with wrappers for **OpenAI** chat models and the **Huggingâ€¯Face** InferenceÂ API.
* **Reproducible** â€“ every run is JSONâ€‘logged for auditable and reproducible results.

## ðŸ”§Â Installation


### 1. Install Miniconda

* Download **Miniconda** for your OS (Windows, macOS):
  [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
* Run the installer and accept the defaults.

  * On Windows, allow the installer to add Conda to your PATH.
  * On macOS, you may need to restart your terminal after installation.

Verify your installation by running the following command in your terminal (for macOS) or Windows Powershell (for Windows):

```bash
conda --version  # Displays conda's version number
```


### 2. Create and activate a Conda environment

Create a fresh environment (Python 3.10 or newer):

```bash
conda create -n your-env-name python=3.10
```

Activate your newly created conda environment:

```bash
conda activate your-env-name
```

Upgrade `pip` inside the environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Verify that `python` and `pip` are properly installed:
```bash
python --version   # should print 3.10.x or higher
pip --version
```

### 3. Install the talkingtomachines package
```bash
pip install \
 --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
 --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
 talkingtomachines
```

### 4. Provide API keys for OpenAI and Hugging Face

Export the API keys for OpenAI and Hugging Face as environment variables on your terminal (for macOS) or Windows Powershell (for Windows):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export HF_API_KEY=hf_...
````

## ðŸš€Â Usage

### CLI Tool

The platform can be used as a CLI tool for non-technical users or users who are not familiar with Python. For this approach, you will need to populate a prompt template to define your experimental setup. Detailed instructions on how to properly set up a prompt template for your experiment can be found here: [`Prompt Template Instructions`](https://github.com/talking-to-machines/talking-to-machines/tree/main/talkingtomachines/interface/README.md)

```bash
# Show all options
$ talkingtomachines --help

# Provide the file path to the prompt template to parse the experimental setup
$ talkingtomachines path/to/prompt/template.xlsx
```

The CLI displays the details of the experimental setup parsed from the prompt template for your verification and waits for your input:

* input `test`Â â€“ runs experiment in **TEST** mode (one randomly selected session per treatment).
* input `full`Â â€“ runs the **FULL** experiment
* input anything elseÂ â€“ terminates experiment immediately.

Experimental results are saved to your root directory as a JSON file containing the raw outputs (`experiment_results/<experiment_id>.json`) and a CSV file containing the formatted outputs (`experiment_results/<experiment_id>.csv`).

### Python Package

The platform can also be imported as a Python package for power users/developers who are interested in creating more advanced experimental designs that are currently not supported by the prompt template.

```python
import talkingtomachines
```

Note: A simple, endâ€‘toâ€‘end Python example on how to construct and conduct an experiment using the talkingtomachines package will be added in the future.
